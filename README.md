# AI Voice Assistant for Automating Business Inquiries
## Overview
This project is an AI voice assistant designed to automate answering repetitive business inquiries over the phone. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the assistant provides accurate and relevant responses to common questions, such as store business hours. The system utilizes a vector database created on OpenAI, allowing the assistant to reference documents and files to fetch pertinent information. Integration with Twilio's API facilitates phone call and voice support, while OpenAI's Chat and Whisper (Audio) API are used for generating and transcribing responses. The entire application is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Features
Automated Responses: Efficiently handles common customer inquiries like store hours, location, and other frequently asked questions.  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Uses a vector database to reference documents and fetch relevant information.  
Twilio Integration: Manages phone calls and provides voice support.  
OpenAI Chat and Whisper API: Generates natural language responses and converts them to speech.  
Flask Framework: Utilized for building the web application and handling HTTP requests.  

## API Endpoints
/intro: Handles the initial call, plays a greeting message, and gathers user input.  
/gather: Processes user input, generates a response using OpenAI's Chat API, synthesizes speech using Whisper API, and plays the response back to the user.  
/static/<filename>: Serves static audio files generated by the assistant.
